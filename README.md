Use the arrow keys to move the frog through the obstacles to the lillypads. Cars and trucks will lose a life, while logs and turtles will help you get across the water. If frog lands in water then you will lose a life. Total of 3 lives to get across the board! You have the option to play hard or easy levels. Good Luck!

This project was a great learning experience and we got to use webpack, linters, and started using ES6 and testing. Getting all the files to talk to each other was a challenge at times, but it was fun watching the game come together.
